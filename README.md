# TS-Hajime 🌸

Effortlessly bootstrap strongly-typed TypeScript npm libraries with minimal configuration and a focus on developer experience.

## 🌟 Features

  - Preconfigured `tsconfig`, `vitest`, `package.json`, and `.gitignore` files.
  - Ready-to-use GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and npm scripts.
  - Examples and tests included for both library code and `npx` commands.
- **TypeScript npx Commands**: Write `npx` commands directly in TypeScript.
- **ESM & CJS Support**: Outputs both ESM and CJS modules.
- **Optimized for VSCode**: Pre-configured with file nesting, auto-prettify on save, and a specified TypeScript TSDK path.
- **Fully Customizable**: Exposed configurations allow for complete customization to fit your needs.
